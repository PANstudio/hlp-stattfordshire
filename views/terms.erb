				<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
				<p>This website, located at hellolamppost.co.uk, is operated by PAN STUDIO LIMITED (registered in England with registration number 8015714 whose registered office is at:</p>

				<p>PAN Studio Limited, First Floor Vintage Yard, 59-63 Bermondsey Street, London, SE1 3XF</p>

				<p>Codes can be found around the city that are normally used to identify public objects for maintenance and monitoring. With Hello Lamp Post we use these codes as identifiers in a city wide network of objects. These codes allow you to either ‘wake up’ a sleeping object or learn what other people have been saying to one that is already awake. Each exchange will last for a few messages and you will be encouraged to come back and talk to the object some more another day. The more you play, the more the hidden life of the city will be revealed. Objects might even start to get attached to you if you talk to them a lot. The only information we share is the responses you give to objects. These can be thought of as public conversations, comparable with those on twitter. They may be shown via sms or on the website or occasionally anonymously in print. We will never show your name, phone number or any other data about you.</p>
